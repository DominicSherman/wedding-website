Where to begin? :)  Well, let's start about 7 years ago when I first met the Sherman family.  I’ll be honest, I don’t remember actually meeting Dominic.  However, I distinctly remember meeting Regina, his sister.  She and her lovely momma came over for one of my Mom's many “Moms’ night outs”, and she and my sisters hung out together.  I remember liking her from the start :) Unfortunately, I only remember bits and pieces of the two years they lived here in Oregon.  But, let me be clear, Dominic and I hardly spoke in those two years.  He, and the rest of the Sherman family became great friends with my family, although I never became very close to any of them in that time, which, as I know now, this was all about timing :) I’ll be honest here.  My only thoughts of Dominic in those two years were, “ good Lord, he’s a spaz”... “does he ever stop moving?” At one point, I even said to myself and to my sisters, “ I would never want to marry a Sherman.” Now, I know that may be confusing because I am, in fact very happily, marrying a Sherman.  Don’t worry I’ll explain:)  

The Sherman family moved away after two years of living in Oregon and I said goodbye to people I never thought would be in my life again.  However, even though they had moved to Iowa, Regina, Dominic, and Gabe would visit Portland which really built up all of the their relationships with people here in a wonderful way.  Through thick and thin, they would still visit. Crazily enough, the three Shermans still made it to Portland despite Oregon’s big snowstorm back in January of 2017.  It was like God was keeping them close to our family. Little did I know it was also to keep Dominic and I close :)  January was the first spark, if you will, with Dominic and I.  At least in my mind it was. I came inside the house after walking our dog Reagan in the snow to greet Dominic, Gabe, and Regina.  Dominic was sitting at our kitchen table surrounded by people and I came up behind and gave him an awkward hug as he was sitting and said “hello”.  All of us ended up being stuck in our house during their whole trip because of the snow.  However, it ended up being one of the very best times of my life :)  It was the first time I had ever really been able to get to know them and really, truly, appreciate them.  We all had so much fun playing cards and board games the entire time. I thought to myself, “I wish this wouldn’t end.” Throughout that trip I was definitely becoming attracted to and interested in Dominic.  However, let me tell you, I did not, I REPEAT, did not let him or anyone else know that. It is not in my nature to let others know my feelings very easily.  Now, I was not aware that Dominic had any feelings for me during this trip (being oblivious is most definitely in my nature).  However, he asked for my number before the trip was over to keep in touch (again, I thought nothing of this… stupid me).  Let me tell you something.  Dominic did, in fact, keep in touch with me for 6 months after January (6...whole...months), but it was only friendly conversation in my mind and I didn't think much of it.  UNTIL.  

His family visited Denver in June, 2017 to see some family living there.  I just so happened to be living in Denver at that time.  When I learned that he was visiting, I asked if any of them would like to meet up with my cousin Valda (aka. Bill) and I.  They agreed, and so Valda and I met with Dominic, his older brother Michael, and Gabe.  I had the greatest time, and oh boy, I was very attracted to Dominic at this point.  Thanks to his hilarious wingmen (Michael and Gabe), Dominic stood out so much to me and I loved hanging out with him that night.  The next day was the ultimate day you’ve all been waiting for throughout this whole spiel. Dominic and I went out to Chipotle for lunch then went to starbucks (I thought when Dominic said to meet for lunch it meant with his siblings. I was wrong...still didn’t catch on...but its fine). Afterwards, he dropped me off at Valda’s house, but before I got out of the car, he said to me “You probably already know this, but, I like you. You don’t need to do anything. I just wanted to tell you because I would have felt bad dating anyone else without telling you. So, I had to be rejected by you so I could move on.”  Now, if you didn’t guess already by what you know about me now, I was slightly shocked.  I told him I would “think about it”.  Obviously I eventually got in my right mind and said yes :)  From then on I’ve been the happiest i've ever been in my entire life and although we have had to do long distance, which is not easy, nothing has been more worth it.  I feel like the luckiest woman on earth and I’m sure any woman feels the same if you have a man that loves you like he loves me :)  I love him and his family so much and I’m so so excited to start this new part of life with my best friend in May :)
