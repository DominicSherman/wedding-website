Mary and I met soon after my family moved to Portland in 2011, and I of course thought she was cute from the beginning. Much to my chagrine, I found out she was almost two years older than me, which at that age was far too large of a gap to overcome. She was part of the “older group”, so I became friends with her younger siblings (but was always on my best behavior when she was around). When we moved in 2013, I knew from experience that most of my friendships there would fizzle out as everybody moved on and we were forced to form new relationships. But I did my best to not let things fade like I had in the past, and my siblings and I kept going back to Portland once or twice a year, and kept in touch as best we could considering none of us had cellphones at the time. 

Fast forward to January of 2017, and my siblings and I were once again back in Portland visiting the Edsons. I had ACL reconstruction 2 weeks before we left, so I was unable to walk, but luckily there was a snowstorm and we were all stuck inside for 10 days with nothing to do but talk and play games. There was easily over a hundred games of Spades and Euchre played during that week. This gave me a lot of time to talk to Mary and get to know her in a way I never had before, and I think that I was finally able to show her I wasn’t the spastic immature 13 year old she remembered. I got her number before I left (for platonic reasons, obviously), and we “just happened” to keep in touch over the next six months (I texted her every single day, but I don’t think she minded). She was a flight attendant in Denver and I was in school, and the more I talked to her, even over text, the more I became sure that I needed to do something. That opportunity came to me when my extended family decided to have the annual reunion in Denver in June. 

My brothers and I met up with her and her cousin to go out to dinner and visit one of the nights that we were there, and we all had a blast. I was surprised to see a text from her on the way home that she wanted to hang out again while we were there, and after much thought (and motivational words from my brothers), I suggested lunch. I spent the entire lunch feeling sick, trying to figure out how I would ask her to date me in a way that it would make it really easy for her to reject me. I decided to wait to ask her until I was dropping her off so that it wouldn’t be awkard if (when) she rejected me. After asking her, she patted me on the back and said “I’ll think about it,” in a way that caused me to call my brother and tell him that she said no. Much to my surprise, she texted me shortly after and told me she wanted to try it, and the rest is history (I never thought I’d be so cliché, sorry). When she first agreed, I was so surprised that she would want to be with me, and I have still felt out of my league every day since then. 

It’s been quite the adventure to get to where we are, and I’m more happy and grateful than I can express that I’ve found a woman like her to spend the rest of my life with. We’ve been long distance for most of our relationship so far while I finish school, but it only makes us that much more excited for when we won’t have to leave each other anymore. It’s easy now to see God’s hand through every step of our relationship, and I can’t wait to see where He takes us next.
