I have had the privilege of watching this relationship unfold from its rather unlikely beginning. When we moved to Oregon, Dominic was a high-pitched and competitive little twat with his dirty-blonde bangs down in his eyes. For some reason, the ladies were all about that. Mary was one of few who tended to keep her distance during our stint there, a behavior that I now agree with wholeheartedly. So when we left in 2013, she was the last person I would have imagined visiting repeatedly in the future. 
	
It was during a fateful visit in January of 2017 that Mary re-entered the picture. By this time, they had grown up a bit. Dominic got a manly voice and muscles (hair still needs work) and Mary actually hung out with us. You know, the important stuff. By some freak of nature, we were snowed into their house (which just doesn’t happen in Portland) and the two of them were forced to have amicable interactions. I can tell when Dominic likes someone. It’s a subtle, yet distinct difference in his behavior towards that woman: he talks to her, and even smiles sometimes. Mary, with every opportunity to cook, clean, play cards, and walk around in pajamas (some of her best qualities), soon had Dominic under her spell. Idk why she liked Dom. Probably his quality personality, thoughtful disposition, advanced skill set, physical prowess, or something stupid like that. When we left, her number had happened to slip into his contacts. In my opinion, he likely won her over when he slid into her DM’s with a killer pickup line: “Hey girl, what that thang do.” 
	
Over the next 6 months, Dominic became my eager protege in the art of wooing a woman (some may dispute this). I graciously imparted some of my wisdom to give him his best shot (cannot confirm the credibility of this statement). By June, Mary was based in Denver as a flight attendant. By another seemingly providential sequence of events, we were visiting the same area for a family reunion. So they were all like “hey let’s meet up, maybe if you feel like it, not a big deal lol rofl lmao stfu smh” or something like that, I don’t know how the young whipper-snappers communicate these days. Our older brother, Michael, and I, activated wing man mode. We and Dom met up with Mary and her cousin, Valda, for an evening of whimsy and shenanigans. Michael and I had a specific strategy that we executed to near perfection: act like idiots to the point that it makes Dominic look really good. Luckily, this is something we’ve been doing our whole lives. Ok, maybe we kind of made fun of Dom the whole time too, but it’s hard to focus when we’re in full idiot mode. I mean, I was fishing mini-golf balls out of ponds for “good luck” and walking like different types of animals. The point is, it worked. Whether we had anything to do with it cannot be confirmed or denied, I will just say: Yes. We are the reason they are getting married. The next day, Dom went out with her on their own (can’t imagine why he didn’t want us to accompany him) and later informed us that she had rejected him. No wait, psych. She wants to date him long-distance. And apparently she had no idea he was into her (??). 
    
Anyways, their relationship took off like the planes they frequently used to visit each other (see what I did there). I think Dom was talking about getting a ring by the next month? Oh, young love. Just a couple of crazy kids. I don’t mean to sound arrogant, but I kind of facilitated the rest of their relationship as well. I made them laugh by eating weird things, I acted like a child to help them practice parenting, I made room for the Holy Spirit by sitting between them, and I ate the food they made together (shh, it helped). I even masterminded the videoing of his proposal the following May (video available elsewhere). I guess what I’m trying to say is, I’m the reason they’re going to be happy for the rest of their lives. You’re welcome.
